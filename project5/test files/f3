It is run from the command line, such as
%  ./a.out 5 f1 f2 f3 f4 f5
where 5 is the number of clients and f1â€¦f5 are the files to transfer. You can assume the command line will be correct and you do not have to check for its structure (not checking is a security risk, but for this project it is ok).
